# Serializable

Serializable is a framework made for creating model objects or structs that can be easily serialized and deserialized from/to JSON. It's implemented using protocol extensions, which makes it easily expandable.

It's easily expandable and handles all common data types used when consuming a REST API, as well as recursive parsing of custom objects.

It's designed to be used together with our helper app, the Model Boiler, making model creation a breeze.

The Serializable framework uses static typing, exhibiting superior performance compared to frameworks using reflection eliminate boilerplate code.
